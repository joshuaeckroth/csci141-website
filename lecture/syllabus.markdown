Late work is penalized 20% for each day that it is late. Submissions more than 3 days late receive no credit. Tests cannot be made up unless a doctor's note is provided.

## Test dates

- Test 1: June 1

- Test 2: June 15

- Final exam is take-home, so we will not meet that day

## Homework

We will spend about an hour each class period working on the homework. You will have a new assignment virtually every day that we meet. Normally, the homework will be due at the beginning of the next class. You must use the [grading site](http://147.253.70.151:8080/) to submit your homework. That site will run your code and tell you if it is correct according to a series of test cases. You can submit as many times as you wish, with no penalty (unless you submit after the deadline).

I will give you login credentials to the submission site on the first day of class.

## Honor code

I am strongly in agreement with the
[Stetson University Honor Code](http://www.stetson.edu/other/honor-system/). Any
form of cheating is not acceptable, will not be tolerated, and could
lead to dismissal from the University. This includes plagiarism of any
sort on homework, reviews, or exams.

## Academic success center

If a student anticipates barriers related to the format or
requirements of a course, she or he should meet with the course
instructor to discuss ways to ensure full participation. If
disability-related accommodations are necessary, please register with
the Academic Success Center (822-7127;
[www.stetson.edu/asc](http://www.stetson.edu/asc)) and notify the
course instructor of your eligibility for reasonable
accommodations. The student, course instructor, and the Academic
Success Center will plan how best to coordinate accommodations. The
Academic Success Center is located at 209 E Bert Fish Drive, and can
be contacted using the email address
[asc@stetson.edu](mailto:asc@stetson.edu).
