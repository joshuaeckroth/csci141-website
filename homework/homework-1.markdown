Skills needed to complete this assignment:

- How to use [Eclipse](/lecture/eclipse.html)
- How to use [git](/lecture/git.html)

# Task 1

The only task for this homework is to create a BitBucket account, create a git repository, add files to it and make a few commits, create a tag, and push your changes up to BitBucket.

I will look at your BitBucket account and grade the assignment from there. You do not submit anything to me.

Here are the steps:

1. Create a free [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org) account.

2. Create an ssh key and upload it to your BitBucket account. (For help, see Step 6 on the [BitBucket documentation page](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/Set+up+SSH+for+Git).)

3. Create a repository. You might must name it "csci141-homework1". Make sure it is a "private" repository.

4. Now, in Eclipse, follow the "basic workflow" instructions in the [git](/lecture/git.html) notes to create a repository and push it to BitBucket.

5. Back at BitBucket, refresh the page so you can see your committed files. Now, on the right side, click "Send invitation" and type "joshuaeckroth". This allows me to view your repository. I will only be able to see commits you have "pushed".

You are now done. When I start grading homework 1, I will download your code (using a program) and grade your most recent commit.

We will "submit" all homework this way. Do no forget to add me to your repository. You must name your repository exactly "csci141-homeworkX" where X is some number. This way my program will find your repository in an automated fashion.
