## Task 1

Recreate this "dot grid" animation. Note, it loops, forever. There are 10 rows and 10 columns, for a maximum 100 dots on the screen at once. Once it hits 100 dots, it starts over. The dots' centers are 20px from each other, and they are each 10px diameter. The frame rate was set to 20. The window size is 200x200.
